# Neural Quantum States

Neural-network-based variational wavefunctions or neural quantum states (NQSs), such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in
approximating ground states (quantum many-body wave function ans√§tzes) of complex quantum systems with the help of Variational Monte Carlo (VMC). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11222" target="_blank">In our paper</a>, we show that these NQSs can provide accurate estimations of ground-state properties, correlation functions as well as quantum phase transitions in many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems.
